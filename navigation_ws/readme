Here is the navigation workspace aka navigation_ws adds multirobot rrt to the package, specifically the dovRobot.launch file. 
The current issue is that when you add an ar tag, the ar tag spawn dies whenever it is in the same gazebo launch file as the multirobot rrt. 
Looking for sometime to be able to spawn both the ar tag and the multirobot rrt as even the door spawner can work with the multirobot rrt
